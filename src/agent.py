AutoGPT
=======

This module implements a simplified version of the AutoGPT process, an autonomous agent that uses the GPT-4 language model to achieve user-defined goals. The process emulates a human-like thought process by iterating through combined steps of planning and criticism, system action, and self-improvement thoughts and reasoning.

Functions
---------
- plan_and_criticism(goal: str) -> Tuple[str, str]
    Formulate a plan to achieve the given goal and evaluate it for potential issues or shortcomings.

- system_action(plan: str) -> str
    Perform an action based on the plan, such as browsing the web, calling an API, or generating text.

- self_improvement_and_reasoning(plan: str, criticism: str, output: str) -> Tuple[str, str]
    Learn from the experience, refine the approach, and apply logic to make decisions based on the plan, criticism, and output.

- auto_gpt(goal: str) -> str
    Main function to simulate the AutoGPT process with the given goal.

Example
-------
To use this module, call the `auto_gpt` function with your desired goal:

    result = auto_gpt("My goal")
    print(result)

You can modify and expand the functions in this module to better suit your specific needs and to handle any limitations or additional requirements.
