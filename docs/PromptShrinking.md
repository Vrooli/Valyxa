# Prompt Configuration Size Testing
This test checks the feasibility of shrinking the token size of prompts without losing any information. The smaller the prompt, the more the AI can remember before we must re-inject the prompt. To measure the size of a prompt, there are currently two options:

1. [Tiktokenizer](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/)  
2. [OpenAI's tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).   

Tiktokenizer is considered more up-to-date than OpenAI's tool, especially when measuring whitespace. We will use Tiktokenizer's results to determine the winning approach.

## The Results
The results are listed from smallest winning token size to largest. Note that we currently only use `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` for our AI, so the other models are not as relevant. In short, JSON without whitespace always wins, followed by YAML, then JSON with whitespace.

It's important to note that this does not measure performance of the prompts. Having whitespace makes the prompt easier to read for humans, so it might be the same for language models. Only testing will tell.

### Tiktokenizer - gpt-3.5-turbo
1. JSON without whitespace: 575 tokens
2. YAML: 659 tokens
3. JSON: 801 tokens

### Tiktokenizer - gpt-4
1. JSON without whitespace: 575 tokens
2. YAML: 659 tokens
3. JSON: 801 tokens

### Tiktokenizer - gpt-4-32k
1. JSON without whitespace: 575 tokens
2. YAML: 659 tokens
3. JSON: 801 tokens

### Tiktokenizer - text-davinci-003
1. JSON without whitespace: 622 tokens
2. YAML: 749 tokens
3. JSON: 928 tokens

### OpenAI - codex
1. JSON without whitespace: 622 tokens
2. YAML: 749 tokens
3. JSON: 929 tokens

### OpenAI - gpt-3
1. JSON without whitespace: 622 tokens
2. YAML: 975 tokens
3. JSON: 1383 tokens

## Converting YAML to JSON
If you are working with a YAML prompt and want to convert it to JSON, TODO

## Test Cases
This test measures the size of JSON without any whitespace (besides inside strings), YAML (which must contain whitespace), and JSON with whitespace (i.e. prettified). Here are the total characters of each configuration:

- JSON without whitespace: 2559 characters
- YAML: 2763 characters
- JSON: 341 characters
