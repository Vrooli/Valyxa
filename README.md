## [üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Developer setup][setup-guide]
Linked is our guide for setting up all Vrooli repos. No extra steps are required.

## Usage
If not using [Vrooli](https://github.com/Vrooli/Vrooli) or another UI that's already set up to use Valyxa, you can send a POST request to `http://localhost:<PORT_VALYXA>` if testing locally, or `https://<your-domain>` if testing on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). The request must follow this structure:

```json
{
    "key": "<your-api-key>", // Can use API_FOR_VROOLI for uncapped usage. Otherwise, we validate and fetch api information from VROOLI_URL
    "message": "Initial response, or reply in conversation",
    "messageId": <message-id>, // ID if continuing message. Must be continuing the conversation using the same key
    "jwt": "<json-web-token>", // If key is API_FOR_VROOLI, this token ensures that the conversation cannot be accessed by anyone else
}
```

# ü¶ú Multilingual Support
We are actively seeking multilingual speakers to help us translate Valyxa's prompts and documentation to make our platform accessible to a wider audience. If you are a multilingual speaker and would like to contribute by providing translations, please add your language to the `translations` folder and submit a pull request. We will review your contribution and, if approved, merge it into the main repository.

Thank you for your support and for helping us build a more inclusive and diverse Vrooli community!
